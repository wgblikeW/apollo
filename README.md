### Introduction

This project is a toy project for the Content Security Lecture, so its design may be wired or seem to be needless. The setting of this lab is quite straightforward and simple, you can implement it in different approaches over some assumptions. You don't need to communicate with other peers using  TCP connections, just create a file and share it with other peers. I choose this lab background to practice Corba framework and Golang.
